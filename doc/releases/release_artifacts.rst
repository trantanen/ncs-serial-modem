     - The unsigned application binary (MCUboot + application) to be flashed with Programmer or nRF Util.
   * - ``.signed.bin``
     - Signed MCUboot binary for S0 slot to be used in FOTA/DFU.
   * - ``_mcuboot_b0_s0_image.signed.bin``
     - Signed MCUboot binary for S1 slot to be used in FOTA/DFU.
   * - ``_mcuboot_b0_s1_image.signed.bin``
     - Signed application only binary to be used in FOTA/DFU.
   * - ``_dfu.zip``
     - Signed application only binary zipped with metadata used by nRF Cloud for FOTA/DFU.
   * - ``.elf``
     - Application image symbols for debugging purposes.
   * - ``.dts``
     - Devicetree.
   * - ``.config``
     - Application image Kconfig options.

For more details about the build artifacts, see the `build output files`_ documentation.

.. note::

   Do not use ``_mtrace`` variants for power measurements.
   The trace UART with HW flow control enabled due to RTT application logging has approximately 700 uA overhead on the power consumption.
