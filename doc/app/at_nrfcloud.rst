.. note::

   These AT commands are `Experimental <Software maturity levels_>`_.

The page describes nRF Cloud-related AT commands.

.. _SM_AT_NRFCLOUD:

nRF Cloud access
================

The ``#XNRFCLOUD`` command controls the access to the nRF Cloud service.

.. note::
   To use ``#XNRFCLOUD``, the following preconditions apply:

   * You must first onboard the device to nRF Cloud, using the device-specific UUID as the device ID.
     See `nRF Cloud Preconnect onboarding`_ for more information.
   * The :ref:`CONFIG_SM_NRF_CLOUD <CONFIG_SM_NRF_CLOUD>` Kconfig option must be enabled.
   * The device must have access to nRF Cloud through the LTE network.

Set command
-----------

The set command allows you to access the nRF Cloud service.

.. note::

   The ``#XNRFCLOUD`` command uses default PDN connection with ID ``0``.
   Raw sockets must not use the PDN connection at the same time.
   See :ref:`SM_AT_SOCKET_RAW_SOCKET_LIMITATION` for more information.

Syntax
~~~~~~

::

   AT#XNRFCLOUD=<op>[,<send_location>]

* The ``<op>`` parameter can have the following integer values:

  * ``0`` - Disconnect from the nRF Cloud service.
  * ``1`` - Connect to the nRF Cloud service.
  * ``2`` - Send a message in the JSON format to the nRF Cloud service.

  When ``<op>`` is ``2``, |SM| enters :ref:`sm_data_mode`.

* The ``<send_location>`` parameter is used only when the value of ``<op>`` is ``1``.
  It can have the following integer values:

  * ``0`` - The device location is not sent to nRF Cloud.
    This is the default behavior if the parameter is omitted.
  * ``1`` - The device location is sent to nRF Cloud.

  .. note::
     The location is sent to the nRF Cloud whenever a fix is produced by the GNSS module.
     You must use the :ref:`#XGNSS <SM_AT_GNSS>` AT command to start GNSS either in single-fix or periodic navigation mode.
     The interval between fixes must be at least 5 seconds.

Unsolicited notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   #XNRFCLOUD: <ready>,<send_location>

* The ``<ready>`` parameter indicates whether the connection to nRF Cloud is established or not.
* The ``<send_location>`` parameter indicates whether the device location will be sent to nRF Cloud or not.

Example
~~~~~~~

::

  // Connect to nRF Cloud without sending location.
  AT#XNRFCLOUD=1

  OK

  #XNRFCLOUD: 1,0
  // Send a message to nRF Cloud.
  AT#XNRFCLOUD=2

  OK
  {"msg":"Hello, nRF Cloud"}+++

  #XDATAMODE: 0
  // Disconnect from nRF Cloud.
  AT#XNRFCLOUD=0

  OK

  #XNRFCLOUD: 0,0
  // Connect to nRF Cloud and send location.
  AT#XNRFCLOUD=1,1

  OK

  #XNRFCLOUD: 1,1
  AT#XNRFCLOUD=0

  #XNRFCLOUD: 0,1

  OK

Read command
------------

The read command checks whether the connection to nRF Cloud is established or not.

Syntax
~~~~~~

::

   AT#XNRFCLOUD?

Response syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   #XNRFCLOUD: <ready>,<send_location>,<sec_tag>,<device_id>

* The ``<ready>`` parameter indicates whether the connection to nRF Cloud is established or not.
* The ``<send_location>`` parameter indicates whether the device location will be sent to nRF Cloud or not.
* The ``<sec_tag>`` parameter indicates the ``sec_tag`` used for accessing nRF Cloud.
* The ``<device_id>`` parameter indicates the device ID used for accessing nRF Cloud.

Example
~~~~~~~

::

  AT#XNRFCLOUD?

  #XNRFCLOUD: 1,0,16842753,"50503041-3633-4261-803d-1e2b8f70111a"

  OK

Test command
------------

The test command tests the existence of the command and provides information about the type of its subparameters.

Syntax
~~~~~~

::

   AT#XNRFCLOUD=?

Example
~~~~~~~

::

  AT#XNRFCLOUD=?

  #XNRFCLOUD: (0,1,2),<send_location>

  OK

.. _SM_AT_NRFCLOUDPOS:

nRF Cloud location
==================

The ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS`` command sends a request to nRF Cloud to determine the device's location.
The request uses information from the cellular network, Wi-Fi® access points, or both.

.. note::
   To use ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS``, the following preconditions apply:

   * The device must be connected to nRF Cloud using :ref:`#XNRFCLOUD <SM_AT_NRFCLOUD>`.
   * The :ref:`CONFIG_SM_NRF_CLOUD_LOCATION <CONFIG_SM_NRF_CLOUD_LOCATION>` Kconfig option must be enabled.

Set command
-----------

The set command allows sending a location request to nRF Cloud.

Syntax
~~~~~~

::

   AT#XNRFCLOUDPOS=<cell_count>,<wifi_pos>[,<MAC 1>[,<RSSI 1>],<MAC 2>[,<RSSI 2>][,<MAC 3>[...]]]

* The ``<cell_count>`` parameter indicates the number of cells to include in the location request.
  The value range is ``0`` to ``15``. A good suggested value for cellular positioning is ``4``.
  ``0`` means that no cellular network information will be included in the location request.
  The |SM| uses the ``AT%NCELLMEAS`` command to retrieve the cellular network information, and depending on the value of ``<cell_count>``, it may use the command multiple times.

  .. note::

     Since the |SM| uses the ``AT%NCELLMEAS`` command internally, the host must not use the ``AT%NCELLMEAS`` command during ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS`` command execution.
     You may still use ``AT%NCELLMEAS`` command before or after ``#XNRFCLOUDPOS`` command execution for your own purposes.

* The ``<wifi_pos>`` parameter can have the following integer values:

  * ``0`` - Do not include Wi-Fi access point information in the location request.
  * ``1`` - Use Wi-Fi access point information.
    The access points must be given as additional parameters to the command.
    The minimum number of access points to provide is two (``NRF_CLOUD_LOCATION_WIFI_AP_CNT_MIN``), and the maximum is limited by the AT command buffer size (:ref:`CONFIG_SM_AT_BUF_SIZE <CONFIG_SM_AT_BUF_SIZE>`).

* The ``<MAC x>`` parameter is a string.
  It indicates the MAC address of a Wi-Fi access point and must be formatted as ``%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x`` (``WIFI_MAC_ADDR_TEMPLATE``).

* The ``<RSSI x>`` parameter is an optional integer.
  It indicates the signal strength of a Wi-Fi access point in dBm, between ``-128`` and ``0``.
  If provided, it must follow the MAC address parameter of the access point.
  Providing the RSSI parameters helps improve the accuracy of the Wi-Fi location.

Unsolicited notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   #XNRFCLOUDPOS: <error>

This is emitted when the location request failed, either when sending it or receiving its response.
No notification containing location data will be emitted.

* The ``<error>`` parameter indicates the error that happened.
  It is one of the :c:enum:`nrf_cloud_error` values.

::

   #XNRFCLOUDPOS: <type>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<uncertainty>

This is emitted when a successful response to a sent location request is received.

* The ``<type>`` parameter indicates the service used to fulfill the location request.

  * ``0`` (:c:enumerator:`LOCATION_TYPE_SINGLE_CELL`) - Single-cell cellular location.
  * ``1`` (:c:enumerator:`LOCATION_TYPE_MULTI_CELL`) - Multi-cell cellular location.
  * ``2`` (:c:enumerator:`LOCATION_TYPE_WIFI`) - Wi-Fi location.

* The ``<latitude>`` parameter represents the latitude in degrees.
* The ``<longitude>`` parameter represents the longitude in degrees.
* The ``<uncertainty>`` parameter represents the radius of the uncertainty circle around the location in meters, also known as Horizontal Positioning Error (HPE).
